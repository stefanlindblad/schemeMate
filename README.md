# schemeMate

schemeMate is a scheme command line interpreter for the [scheme](http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/intro.html#./intro:h1) language written in C. 

Clone the repository and execute "make" to build the source code.
Afterwards you can launch schemeMate by typing "schemeMate" in your CMD.

The repository also contains config files to use Visual Studio Code
in combination with GCC / GDB to develop with the interpreter.
The json config files would need to be adopted to your compiler location.

Requirements: make and gcc compiler installed. If you wanna use another compiler, just adopt the make file.
